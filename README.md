# Pima Indians Diabetes Prediction using ANN

This project builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on medical diagnostic measurements from the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** is provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains medical data for female patients of Pima Indian heritage who are at least 21 years old.

- **Number of instances:** 768  
- **Number of features:** 8 input features + 1 binary output  
- **Prediction Task:** Binary classification â€” whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0)

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

I implemented a simple Artificial Neural Network using Keras with the following architecture:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu',  input_shape = (8, )))
model.add(Dense(16, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

## ðŸ”§ Hyperparameter Tuning

I performed hyperparameter tuning using **Keras Tuner** to search for the best combination of:

- Number of units in each layer  
- Activation functions  
- Optimizer choice

The tuning was done using the `RandomSearch` strategy from `keras_tuner`.

âœ… **After tuning, the model achieved an accuracy of approximately 75% on the validation set.**
